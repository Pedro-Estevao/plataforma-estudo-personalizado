# Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the way this boilerplate was implemented, or with the packages used in it, I recommend that you contact us immediately.

I will investigate all legitimate reports and do my best to fix the issue quickly. As long as it's within my reach.

Email [contato@pedroestevao.com](mailto:contato@pedroestevao.com) to disclose any security vulnerabilities.
